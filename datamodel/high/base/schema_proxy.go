// SchemaProxy exists as a stub that will create a Schema once (and only once) the Schema() method is called. An
// underlying low-level SchemaProxy backs this high-level one.
//
// Why use a Proxy design?
//
// There are three reasons.
//
// 1. Circular References and Endless Loops.
//
// JSON Schema allows for references to be used. This means references can loop around and create infinite recursive
// structures, These 'Circular references' technically mean a schema can NEVER be resolved, not without breaking the
// loop somewhere along the chain.
//
// Polymorphism in the form of 'oneOf' and 'anyOf' in version 3+ only exacerbates the problem.
//
// These circular traps can be discovered using the resolver, however it's still not enough to stop endless loops and
// endless goroutine spawning. A proxy design means that resolving occurs on demand and runs down a single level only.
// preventing any run-away loops.
//
// 2. Performance
//
// Even without circular references, Polymorphism creates large additional resolving chains that take a long time
// and slow things down when building. By preventing recursion through every polymorphic item, building models is kept
// fast and snappy, which is desired for realtime processing of specs.
//
//  - Q: Yeah, but, why not just use state to avoiding re-visiting seen polymorphic nodes?
//  - A: It's slow, takes up memory and still has runaway potential in very, very long chains.
//
// 3. Short Circuit Errors.
//
// Schemas are where things can get messy, mainly because the Schema standard changes between versions, and
// it's not actually JSONSchema until 3.1, so lots of times a bad schema will break parsing. Errors are only found
// when a schema is needed, so the rest of the document is parsed and ready to use.
